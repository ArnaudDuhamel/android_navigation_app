# Sample Android application showing navigation inside the application

This application is based on the tutorial at this link: https://dev.to/jbc7ag/jetpack-compose-navigation-tutorial-9en

A very good and straightforward tutorial.

I also added navigating back.

The repository can be cloned and it should work out of the box as of October 1, 2023 by running it in Android Studio.

## Context

This application was created in connection with the course mobile programming in the bachelor of programming at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, cohort 2021.
